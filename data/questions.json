    "question": "Briefly explain the distinction between a within-subject design and a between-subject design. What is the beauty of the within-subject design? If it is so beautiful, why isn\u2019t it always used?",
    "expected_answer": "Within-subject design exposes the same subjects to multiple treatments, while between-subject design uses different subjects for each treatment. The beauty of within-subject design is that it controls for individual heterogeneity and increases statistical power. It is not always used because it can create order effects, learning effects, contamination across treatments, and demand effects.",

    "question": "In order to make inferences about causality, why is it necessary to have a full factorial design when varying treatments in two dimensions?",
    "expected_answer": "A full factorial design includes all combinations of treatment levels, allowing researchers to identify both main effects and interaction effects. Without all combinations, effects become confounded and causal inference is compromised.",

    "expected_answer": "Strong demand effects occur if subjects try to confirm perceived hypotheses. Weak demand effects occur if subjects infer social expectations (e.g., gender norms). In GNR, anonymity and real incentives reduce these concerns, making demand effects possible but likely small.",

    "question": "Should we worry that subjects were already exerting near-maximal effort in the non-competitive environment in GNR?",
    "expected_answer": "This is a potential concern because if effort was already maximal, competition would not increase performance. However, observed increases in effort under competition suggest baseline effort was not maximal.",
